#Hw1 - You shouldnâ€™t use z_score builtin function. You should use equation  of z score.
for iteration in range(num_iterations):
this should be function for more readible code.
Hw2 - very good. You can use epsilon in logistic loss because in log we want to prevent division by zero. Hw report is very good, thank you.
